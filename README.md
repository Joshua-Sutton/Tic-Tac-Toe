# Tic Tac Toe
This C++ program uses the WinSock2 libaray to create a UDP scoket between two computers in order to send the location of the respected players marker (player 1 is 'X' and player 2 is 'O').  

 
 One key feature of the Tic Tac Toe Program is that the program has automatic checks in place to see if there is a winner, loser and a tie, and sends the appropriate message to the console
 
 Another key feature is that Tic Tac Toe will automatically quit if a user takes to long to place a marker (this can be changed in the wait function call, by deafult is set to 20 seconds and 0 milliseconds). If the user takes to long to place a piece then the user is alerted that he has lost and the opponent has won the match by deafult, with respected message to conosle of respeted player.
 
 Another key feature is that Tic Tac Toe has limits on what input can we accepeted, only ints can be accepted and ints only in the range of 1-9 (places on game board). When a user inputs a invailid input the user will be prompted that the input was not accept and will ask for another input.
 
 Another key feature is that Tic Tac Toe will kepp track of who is playing who by logging the IP address of the player and when the program recives a UDP datagram it will compare it to the IP address in a varible in the program and if the IP address match Tic Tac Toe will continue to place marker on game board.
